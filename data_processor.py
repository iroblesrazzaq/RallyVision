#
# from data_processor import DataProcessor
#
# # 1. Initialize the processor
# processor = DataProcessor(screen_width=1280, screen_height=720)
#
# # 2. Load the court-filtered data
# npz_path = 'path/to/your/court_filtered_data.npz'
# all_frames_data = np.load(npz_path, allow_pickle=True)['frames']
#
# # 3. Process the entire video sequence
# lstm_input_sequence = []
# previous_players = None
# for frame_data in all_frames_data:
#     # Step A: Assign players using the core heuristic
#     assigned_players = processor.assign_players(frame_data)
#     
#     # Step B: Convert the assignment into a feature vector
#     feature_vector = processor.create_feature_vector(assigned_players, previous_players)
#     
#     lstm_input_sequence.append(feature_vector)
#     previous_players = assigned_players  # Store for next iteration
#
# # 4. Final result is a NumPy array ready for the model
# lstm_ready_data = np.array(lstm_input_sequence)
# print(f"Successfully created LSTM input data with shape: {lstm_ready_data.shape}")

"""
My test.py file is my current evaluation file. however, it just looks at sequences, not the whole video. 
I need to further establish my post processing pipeline. The final output of my pipeline should be 
a csv of start_time, end_times, which i can compare to the annotated targets. 
For now, we will use the same gaussian smoothing and hysteresis filtering that we're using in the test.py file. 

Your task is to write a new file that runs the inference on an entire video's sequence file

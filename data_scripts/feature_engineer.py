    Creates feature vectors from preprocessed tennis pose data.
    
    This class takes preprocessed data with player assignments and creates
    feature vectors for training the tennis point detection model.
    
    Features include:
    - Player bounding boxes and centroids
    - Player velocities (calculated from consecutive frame positions)
    - Player accelerations (calculated from consecutive frame velocities)
    - Player speed and acceleration magnitudes
    - Keypoint positions, velocities, accelerations, speeds, and confidences
    - Limb lengths for anatomical structure analysis
    
    Proper acceleration calculation requires velocity data from three consecutive frames.

    - 1: Presence flag
    - 4: Bounding box coordinates
    - 2: Centroid coordinates
